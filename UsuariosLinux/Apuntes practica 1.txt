cat /etc/default/useradd 



# Default values for useradd(8)
#
# The SHELL variable specifies the default login shell on your
# system.
# Similar to DHSELL in adduser. However, we use "sh" here because
# useradd is a low level utility and should be as general
# as possible
SHELL=/bin/sh
#
# The default group for users
# 100=users on Debian systems
# Same as USERS_GID in adduser
# This argument is used when the -n flag is specified.
# The default behavior (when -n and -g are not specified) is to create a
# primary user group with the same name as the user being added to the
# system.
# GROUP=100
#
# The default home directory. Same as DHOME for adduser
# HOME=/home
#
# The number of days after a password expires until the account 
# is permanently disabled
# INACTIVE=-1
#
# The default expire date
# EXPIRE=
#
# The SKEL variable specifies the directory containing "skeletal" user
# files; in other words, files such as a sample .profile that will be
# copied to the new user's home directory when it is created.
# SKEL=/etc/skel
#
# Defines whether the mail spool should be created while
# creating the account
# CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes




cat /etc/login.defs 




#
# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the login package.
#
# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.
# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will
# be assumed.  All other items are optional - if not specified then
# the described action or option will be inhibited.
#
# Comment lines (lines beginning with "#") and blank lines are ignored.
#
# Modified for Linux.  --marekm

# REQUIRED for useradd/userdel/usermod
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE,
#   MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#
#   Essentially:
#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for
#       login, su, etc.
#
# This is a temporary situation: setting these variables will soon
# move to /etc/default/useradd and the variables will then be
# no more supported
MAIL_DIR        /var/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

#
# Enable logging and display of /var/log/faillog login failure info.
# This option conflicts with the pam_tally PAM module.
#
FAILLOG_ENAB		yes

#
# Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded.
#
# WARNING: Unknown usernames may become world readable. 
# See #290803 and #298773 for details about how this could become a security
# concern
LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB	no

#
# Enable logging of successful logins
#
LOG_OK_LOGINS		no

#
# Enable "syslog" logging of su activity - in addition to sulog file logging.
# SYSLOG_SG_ENAB does the same for newgrp and sg.
#
SYSLOG_SU_ENAB		yes
SYSLOG_SG_ENAB		yes

#
# If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.
#
#SULOG_FILE	/var/log/sulog

#
# If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment parameter.
# Each line of the file is in a format something like "vt100  tty01".
#
#TTYTYPE_FILE	/etc/ttytype

#
# If defined, login failures will be logged here in a utmp format
# last, when invoked as lastb, will read /var/log/btmp, so...
#
FTMP_FILE	/var/log/btmp

#
# If defined, the command name to display when running "su -".  For
# example, if this is defined as "su" then a "ps" will display the
# command is "-su".  If not defined, then "ps" would display the
# name of the shell actually being run, e.g. something like "-sh".
#
SU_NAME		su

#
# If defined, file which inhibits all the usual chatter during the login
# sequence.  If a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the
# user's name or shell are found in the file.  If not a full pathname, then
# hushed mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user's home directory.
#
HUSHLOGIN_FILE	.hushlogin
#HUSHLOGIN_FILE	/etc/hushlogins

#
# *REQUIRED*  The default PATH settings, for superuser and normal users.
#
# (they are minimal, add the rest in the shell startup files)
ENV_SUPATH	PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
ENV_PATH	PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

#
# Terminal permissions
#
#	TTYGROUP	Login tty will be assigned this group ownership.
#	TTYPERM		Login tty will be set to this permission.
#
# If you have a "write" program which is "setgid" to a special group
# which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and
# TTYPERM to 0620.  Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign
# TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
#
# In Debian /usr/bin/bsd-write or similar programs are setgid tty
# However, the default and recommended value for TTYPERM is still 0600
# to not allow anyone to write to anyone else console or terminal

# Users can still allow other people to write them by issuing 
# the "mesg y" command.

TTYGROUP	tty
TTYPERM		0600

#
# Login configuration initializations:
#
#	ERASECHAR	Terminal ERASE character ('\010' = backspace).
#	KILLCHAR	Terminal KILL character ('\025' = CTRL/U).
#	UMASK		Default "umask" value.
#
# The ERASECHAR and KILLCHAR are used only on System V machines.
# 
# UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by
# useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
# 022 is the "historical" value in Debian for UMASK
# 027, or even 077, could be considered better for privacy
# There is no One True Answer here : each sysadmin must make up his/her
# mind.
#
# If USERGROUPS_ENAB is set to "yes", that will modify this UMASK default value
# for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is
# the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be
# used as group permissions, e. g. 022 will become 002.
#
# Prefix these values with "0" to get octal, "0x" to get hexadecimal.
#
ERASECHAR	0177
KILLCHAR	025
UMASK		022

#
# Password aging controls:
#
#	PASS_MAX_DAYS	Maximum number of days a password may be used.

#	PASS_WARN_AGE	Number of days warning given before a password expires.
#
PASS_MAX_DAYS	99999

# System accounts
#SYS_GID_MIN		  100
#SYS_GID_MAX		  999

#
# Max number of login retries if password is bad. This will most likely be
# overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has it's own built
# in of 3 retries. However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using
# an authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.
#
LOGIN_RETRIES		5

#
# Max time in seconds for login
#
LOGIN_TIMEOUT		60

#
# Which fields may be changed by regular users using chfn - use
# any combination of letters "frwh" (full name, room number, work
# phone, home phone).  If not defined, no changes are allowed.
# For backward compatibility, "yes" = "rwh" and "no" = "frwh".
# 
CHFN_RESTRICT		rwh

#
# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?
# Default in no.
#
DEFAULT_HOME	yes

#
# If defined, this command is run when removing a user.
# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
# the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).
#
#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# If set to yes, userdel will remove the user´s group if it contains no
# more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name
# of the user.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

#
# Instead of the real user shell, the program specified by this parameter
# will be launched, although its visible name (argv[0]) will be the shell's.
# The program may do whatever it wants (logging, additional authentification,
# banner, ...) before running the actual shell.
#
# FAKE_SHELL /bin/fakeshell

#
# If defined, either full pathname of a file containing device names or
# a ":" delimited list of device names.  Root logins will be allowed only
# upon these devices.
#
# This variable is used by login and su.
#
#CONSOLE	/etc/consoles
#CONSOLE	console:tty01:tty02:tty03:tty04

#
# List of groups to add to the user's supplementary group set
# when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
# setting).  Default is none.
#
# Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
# access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.
# How to do it is left as an exercise for the reader...
#
# This variable is used by login and su.
#
#CONSOLE_GROUPS		floppy:audio:cdrom

#
# If set to "yes", new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based
# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to "no" if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don't understand the new algorithm.  Default is "no".
#
# This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.
#
#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	no

#
# If set to MD5 , MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
# Overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB option
#
# Note: It is recommended to use a value consistent with
# the PAM modules configuration.
#
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

#
# Only used if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
#
# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password.
# But note also that it more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate
# users.
#
# If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).
# The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.
# If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
# If MIN > MAX, the highest value will be used.
#
# SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
# SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000

FSTAB
Located in "/etc/fstab", it is used to mount other partitions at startup. 


MTAB
This file lists all currently mounted filesystems along with their initialization options. mtab has a lot in common with fstab, the main distinction being that the latter lists all available filesystems whereas the former lists only currently mounted ones. Therefore mtab is usually in a format similar to that of fstab. Most of the time it is possible to directly use lines from mtab in fstab
